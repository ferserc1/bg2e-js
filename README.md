# Business Grade Graphic Engine - JavaScript API

## About

This library is the WebGL/JavaScript counterpart of the bg2 engine C++ API. This library provides an API to
load scenes and models created with the bg2 Composer tool.

This project is currently a draft, and the authors recommends not to use it because it may be unstable.

## Structure

The repository contains directories with bg2 engine base packages, which can be compiled independently to generate npm packages. But it is also possible to use this same repository as uncompiled source code, e.g. for Electron applications.
